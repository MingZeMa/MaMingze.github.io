        ## RoboMaster Introduction
        RoboMaster University Championship is the main competition that our team participates in. The RoboMaster University Championship focuses on the comprehensive application and engineering practice abilities of the participants in science and engineering disciplines, fully integrating many robot-related technical disciplines such as "machine vision", "embedded system design", "mechanical control", "inertial navigation", "human-computer interaction". At the same time, the innovative combination of e-sports presentation and robotic competition makes the robot confrontation more intuitive and intense, attracting te attention of many technology enthusiasts and the public.

        # Introduction of RMUL
        The RoboMaster University League (RMUL), which is sponsored by local academic institutions and universities, aims to promote the exchange of robotics technology between regional universities, foster a supportive academic environment, and contribute to regional technological innovation and development. Participating teams can also advance to the RoboMaster University Championship through the Scoring and Ranking System.


        # My Volunter Work in RMUL
        My position is a technical support volunteer in the operating room. During the competition, both players need to manipulate the robots in the operation room, and they need to use computers, keyboards, headsets, graphic transmissions, etc. I need to guide the operators to use these items during the competition, and help them when they encounter problems. I need to guide the operators to use these items during the competition, and provide help when the operators encounter problems during the competition to ensure that the competition can be carried out normally and stably.
